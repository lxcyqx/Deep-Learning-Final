292,heart,secret,We lead two different lives Just like two lines that never cross And here we are together Standing closer than we are But we re still standing here untouched Too scared to make a move We want so much to touch And we can t wait forever We know it s dangerous For us to be together How do we ever keep this secret How do we keep it in the dark And if we dare to taste our weakness How could we tear ourselves apart Why do we keep this love together Didn t we know right from the start That we would have to keep this secret Or forever stay apart I watch you coming to me Walking in the pouring rain I can t help looking at you Wishing I could stay away So many times I ve tried in vain To close my eyes and pray it goes away But I can t stop myself from feeling To let you go would be too much For me to take,love
293,reo speedwagon,in my dreams,There was a time some time ago When every sunrise meant a sunny day oh a sunny day But now when the morning light shines in It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay oh where I lay I used to thank the lord when I d wake For life and love and the golden sky above me But now I pray the stars will go on shinin You see in my dreams you love me Daybreak is a joyful time Just listen to the songbird harmonies oh the harmonies But I wish the dawn would never come I wish there was silence in the trees oh the trees If only I could stay asleep at least I could pretend you re thinkin of me Cause night time is the one time I am happy You see in my dreams We climb and climb and at the top we fly Let the world go on below us we are lost in time And I don t know really what it means All I know is that you love me in my dreams I keep hopin one day I ll awaken and somehow she ll be lying by my side And if I wonder if the dawn is really breakin She touches me and suddenly I m alive,love

296,bon jovi,bed of roses,Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don t know Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head And some blonde gave me nightmares I think that she s still in my bed As I dream about movies they won t make of me when I m dead With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we re talking About all of the things that I long to believe About love and the truth and what you mean to me And the truth is baby you re all that I need I want to lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh I wanna be just as close as The Holy Ghost is And lay you down On a bed of roses Well I m so far away that each step that I take is on my way home A king s ransom in dimes I d given each night just to see through this payphone Still I run out of time or it s hard to get through Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I ll just close my eyes and whisper Baby blind love is true,love

299,styx,show me the way,Every night I say a prayer In the hopes that there s a Heaven And every day I m more confused As the saints turn into sinners All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay And I feel this empty place inside So afraid that I ve lost my faith Show me the way show me the way Take me tonight to the river And wash my illusions away Please show me the way And as I slowly drift to sleep For a moment dreams are sacred I close my eyes and know there s peace In a world so filled with hatred Then I wake up each morning and turn on the news To find we ve so far to go And I keep on hoping for a sign So afraid I just won t know,love
