but he answer'd, do not presume o young-man but as we here remain behold thy lot which will soon appear when the darkness passes away, so i remain'd with him sitting in the twisted root of an oak, he was suspended in a fungus, which hung with the head downward into the deep, by degrees we beheld the infinite abyss, fiery as the smoke of a burning city; beneath us at an immense distance was the sun, black but shining; round it were fiery tracks on which revolv'd vast spiders, crawling after their prey; which flew or rather swum in the infinite deep, in the most terrific shapes of animals sprung from corruption, and the air was full of them, and seem'd composed of them; these are devils, and arc called powers of the air. i now asked my companion which was my eternal lot? he said, between the black and white spiders, but now, from between the black and white spiders, a cloud and fire burst and rolled thro' the deep, blackning all beneath, so that the nether deep grew black as a sea and rolled with a terrible noise; beneath us was nothing now to be seen but a black tempest, till looking east between the clouds and the waves, we saw a cataract of blood mixed with fire, and not many stones throw from us appear'd and sunk again the scaly fold of a monstrous serpent; at last to the east, distant about three degrees appear'd a fiery crest above the waves; slowly it reared like a ridge of golden rocks till we discover'd two globes of crimson fire, from which the sea fled away in clouds of smoke, and now we saw, it was the head of leviathan; his forehead was divided into streaks of green and purple like those on a tygers forehead: soon we saw his mouth and red gills hang just above the raging foam tinging the black deep with beams of blood, advancing toward us with all the fury of a spiritual existence, my friend the angel climb'd up from his station into the mill, i remain'd alone, and then this appearance was no more, but i found myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moonlight hearing a harper who sung to the harp, and his theme was, the man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind, but i arose, and sought for the mill and there i found my angel, who surprised asked me how i escaped?, i answer'd, all that we saw was owing to your metaphysics; for when you ran away, i found myself on a bank by moonlight hearing a harper. but now we have seen my eternal lot, shall i shew you yours? he laugh'd at my proposal; but i by force suddenly caught him in my arms, and flew westerly thro' the night, till we were elevated above the earths shadow; then i flung myself with him directly into the body of the sun; here i clothed myself in white, and taking in my hand swedenborgs volumes, sunk from the glorious clime, and passed all the planets till we came to saturn; here i staid to rest, and then leap'd into the void, between saturn and the fixed stars, here, said i! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be call'd. soon we saw the stable and the church, and i took him to the altar and open'd the bible, and lo! it was a deep pit, into which i descended driving the angel before me; soon we saw seven houses of brick; one we enter'd; in it were a number of monkeys, baboons, and all of that species, chain'd by the middle, grinning and snatching at one another, but withheld by the shortness of their chains; however i saw that they sometimes grew numerous, and then the weak were caught by the strong, and with a grinning aspect, first coupled with and then devour'd, by plucking off first one limb and then another till the body was left a helpless trunk; this after grinning and kissing it with seeming fondness they devour'd too; and here and there i saw one savourily picking the flesh off of his own tail; as the stench terribly annoy'd us both we went into the mill, and i in my hand brought the skeleton of a body, which in the mill was aristotles analytics, so the angel said: thy phantasy has imposed upon me and thou oughtest to be ashamed, i answer'd: we impose on one another, and it is but lost time to converse with you whose works are only analytics, opposition is true friendship"

baby i want, the two of us to make this night warm, oh yeah i am running to you, what you're telling me with your eyes, you are always so beautiful, you always fall into my arms, i hug you baby now, that's how again, my body doesn't listen to me, and i'm scared that you'll find out, that you'll notice that i'm nervous, first i pretend like nothing's the matter, i kiss you baby now, i'm nervous again, my body keeps wanting you, it hasn't forgotten, will you be the light, in this night that's always dark, without turning away, all you have to do is hug me, this world is dark and dreary, the curtain of darkness swallows the light, so that i can't bring you to me, it blocks and forces me to stand and imagine regret, but nothing can win over instinct, this night i keep finding you countless times for no reason, all i'm doing is, i'm running towards you through the darkness, and telling you now what i should i have said, light jokes and gestures, all you need to do is do the things you want, looking at you, and smiling, that becomes the life that i want, i hug you baby now and i'll kiss you baby, i smudge you on my black drawing paper everyday, and the world is full of light, you know mean this world is full of you, i hug you baby now, that's how again, my body doesn't listen to me, and i'm scared that you'll find out, that you'll notice that i'm nervous, first i pretend like nothing's the matter, i kiss you baby now, i'm nervous again, my body keeps wanting you, it hasn't forgotten, will you be the light, in this night that's always dark, without turning away, all you have to do is hug me, all you have to do is run to me again, and just hug me, every moment that you're not here, i will be wanting you, i hug you baby now, that's how again, my body doesn't listen to me, and i'm scared that you'll find out, that you'll notice that i'm nervous, first i pretend like nothing's the matter, i kiss you baby now, i'm nervous again, my body keeps wanting you, it hasn't forgotten, will you be the light, in this night that's always dark, without turning away, all you have to do is hug me"

my heart flutter, you're so beautiful, the one and only, beautiful, your perfection is like a dream, i'm afraid you'll disappear, there are waves in your brown eyes, i'm falling into them, can't escape from your eyes, i finally found my four clover, my jackpot was always you, take me to the high place, be my luck, baby i'm lucky, i feel good, i like it, the answer to my feelings for you is okie dokie, i'm always five minutes away, ring ring, when my phone vibrates and i hear your voice, i'll leave right away, an endless party, till the sun comes up, woo baby, your dazzling smile makes
